# Selenium Web Automation Testing Project for Daraz
Web Automation Project on Daraz's site

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the testing of the Daraz website (https://www.daraz.com.bd/) using Selenium WebDriver. Selenium WebDriver is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, allowing for the creation of robust and efficient test scripts to validate the functionality, performance, and user experience of web applications.

## Key Objectives
- Functional Testing: Automate the testing of key functionalities of the Daraz website, including navigation, search, product listing, add to cart, checkout, and user account management.

- Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure compatibility and consistency across different web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

- Regression Testing: Automate the execution of regression test suites to ensure that new changes or updates do not introduce unexpected bugs or regressions.

- Performance Testing: Measure and analyze the performance of web pages and interactions to identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization.

- UI Testing: Validate the layout, styling, and responsiveness of the Daraz website across various devices and screen resolutions.

## Project Structure
- Test Scripts: Contains Selenium WebDriver test scripts written in programming languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript.

- Test Data: Includes test data such as user credentials, search queries, and product information used in test scenarios.

- Page Objects: Organizes web page elements and functionalities into reusable components to improve code maintainability and readability.

- Test Reports: Stores generated test reports, including screenshots and logs, for documentation and analysis.

## How to Run Selenium Tests
- Setup Selenium Environment: Install Selenium WebDriver and the necessary browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) compatible with your preferred programming language and environment.

- Write Test Scripts: Create Selenium WebDriver test scripts using your chosen programming language, incorporating appropriate test frameworks and assertions.

- Execute Tests: Run the Selenium tests against the Daraz website, either locally or in a continuous integration (CI) environment, to automate the testing process.

- Analyze Results: Review test reports, logs, and screenshots generated during test execution to identify any failures or issues.

- Debug and Maintain: Debug failed tests, update test scripts as needed to accommodate changes in the Daraz website, and continuously improve test coverage and reliability.
